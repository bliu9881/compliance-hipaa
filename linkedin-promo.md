🏥 Introducing AuroScan: AI-Powered HIPAA Compliance Scanning

We've built several medical Agentic AI applications that save lives—from early cancer prediction to intelligent diabetes management systems. But with great innovation comes great responsibility: ensuring every line of code meets HIPAA's rigorous security standards.

HIPAA compliance has always been our top priority, but the manual audit process was time-consuming and error-prone. So we built a solution.

Introducing AuroScan — an AI-powered web application that automatically scans your source code for HIPAA violations in real-time. It analyzes your codebase against Security Rule, Privacy Rule, and Breach Notification Rule requirements, surfacing critical issues before they become compliance risks.

✅ Automated scanning (GitHub repos or file uploads)
✅ AI-driven analysis with actionable remediation
✅ Real-time compliance scoring
✅ Zero code storage—your data stays private

We've tested it extensively on our production medical applications, and it's proven invaluable for maintaining compliance velocity without sacrificing security.

If you're building healthcare technology, HIPAA compliance shouldn't slow you down. Let AuroScan handle the heavy lifting.
